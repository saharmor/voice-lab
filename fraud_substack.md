# What happens when a subscriber disputes a paid subscription on Substack

If a subscriber disputes a paid subscription on Substack, it can lead to a chargeback. A chargeback occurs when a subscriber contacts their bank or credit card company to reverse a transaction. This can happen for various reasons, such as:

- The subscriber doesn't recognize the charge.
- The subscriber believes the charge was unauthorized.
- The subscriber is dissatisfied with the content or service provided.

When a chargeback is initiated, the following steps occur:

1. **Notification**: Substack receives a notification from the payment processor about the dispute.
2. **Investigation**: Substack reviews the transaction details and any relevant information to assess the validity of the dispute.
3. **Response**: Substack may provide evidence to the payment processor to challenge the dispute if it's believed to be unwarranted.
4. **Resolution**: The payment processor makes a final decision on the dispute, which can result in the funds being returned to the subscriber or retained by the publisher.

It's important to note that chargebacks can result in a loss of revenue for publishers and may incur additional fees. To minimize the risk of disputes:

- Ensure clear and transparent communication with subscribers about subscription terms.
- Provide high-quality content that meets subscriber expectations.
- Address subscriber concerns promptly and professionally.
