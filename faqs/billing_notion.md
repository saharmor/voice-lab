## Notion billing basics

### You're billed per member

Notion uses a billing model that charges you based on the number of seats, or licenses, you are using in your workspace. One seat is assigned to each member (not guest) in your workspace. This billing model gives you the flexibility to change which specific people join your Notion workspace as a member, without accruing new charges every time you add a new user.

Here’s an example:

- Your team is working with three contractors, who have been added as members to your Notion instance. When their contracts are finished, you remove them from your Notion workspace.
- Until the end of your billing period (monthly or annual), you will still have three paid seats in Notion that you can instead fill with new contractors, new hires, interns, or anyone else who you might want to add to your workspace as a member.

Learn more about workspace members and how to manage them [here](https://www.notion.so).

When you add members to your workspace:

- Regardless of whether you're paying yearly or monthly, our system reviews how many members you've added and issues invoices on a monthly basis.
- You only pay for the fraction of the billing interval that a member belonged to your workspace.
- Because you pay at the beginning of every billing interval, these charges for changes made in the middle of a billing interval are added retroactively to your next invoice.
- On a monthly plan, this means you get your regular monthly invoice billing you for the month ahead (including new members), but the invoice will also include retroactive prorated charges for the members you added during your last billing interval.

On a yearly plan, this means you'll receive an invoice at the next month mark (on the same calendar date you bought your plan) that will include two things:

- The amount due for each new member for the remainder of your year-long plan.
- Retroactive charges for those new members prorated based on the amount of time they've belonged to your workspace.

When you remove members from your workspace:

- After removing members, you will still have access to any existing paid seats until the end of your billing interval. You can add new members to fill these seats at no additional charge.
- When your billing interval ends, we will recalculate the total number of paid seats in use in your workspace and bill you accordingly.

Go to `Settings` in your sidebar → `People` to view how many paid seats your workspace has, how many members are currently in your workspace, and when you'll be billed next. You can easily manage the members in your workspace here.

### We bill you upfront

You always pay for Notion at the start of your billing interval. If you make changes in the middle of a billing interval, we'll prorate how much you're charged, so that you only pay for what you actually used. These prorations will be applied at the start of the next billing interval.

### Every workspace is billed separately

You can create multiple workspaces per account (in other words, per email address you signed up with), in which case you'd receive multiple bills. This is why you might see multiple charges for Notion even if you have only one account.

- If you have multiple workspaces, you'll be billed based on how many members you have in each (on a Plus, Business, or Enterprise Plan).
- Even if the same people are in multiple workspaces, you'll be charged for them in each one.

### Your billing interval is set at the workspace level

You could have one workspace billed annually and one billed monthly. You pay less when you choose annual billing. Everyone who joins your workspace will add an additional charge based on the interval of that workspace.

## Yearly vs. monthly billing

You can choose to pay for Notion on a yearly or monthly basis. This impacts both how much you pay and when you pay.

- Yearly billing costs less.
- Your plan renews automatically either once a year or once a month.
  - If you pay yearly, your plan will renew on the same calendar day you first purchased it for all following years.
  - If you pay monthly, the same is true of each following month.
  - For example, a yearly plan bought on May 3 will renew May 3 the next year, and a monthly plan renews June 3.
- Your bill adjusts for your paid seat count either once a year or once a month.
  - If you pay yearly, the number of licenses you are paying for will be recalculated and reflected in your billing once a year, on the same calendar date as when you first purchased Notion.
  - This is the only time during the year when your billing will change to reflect any paid seats that have been removed from your workspace.
  - If you pay monthly, this recalculation will occur once a month on the same calendar date. Your billing will reflect any paid seats that have been removed from your workspace.
  - When your plan renews, you will only be billed for the number of members currently in the workspace. This means your bill will go down if you have removed members since your last bill, and it will go up if you have added members since your last bill.

If you expect your team size to fluctuate often, or you’d like more control over your budget, we recommend a monthly billing interval.
