# Connect Sonos to a New Router or Wi-Fi Network

Your Sonos system needs updated network information after you've changed your Wi-Fi network name, password, or replaced your router. This guide will help you connect your Sonos system to a new router or Wi-Fi network.

## Sonos App for iOS or Android

You can use the Sonos app to connect supported Sonos products to your new or updated Wi-Fi network. The app will guide you through updating each Sonos product's Wi-Fi information one by one.

1. Open the Sonos app and wait while it searches for your Sonos system.
2. When the Sonos app shows "No products found," select **Go to System Settings**.
3. Under **Your System**, select **Update network**.
4. Follow the instructions to connect your Sonos products to your new router or Wi-Fi network.

### Unsupported Products

Currently, the Sonos app can update Wi-Fi settings on Sonos products that are capable of using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Some Sonos products don't have BLE capabilities, so the Sonos app will not be able to discover them to update their Wi-Fi network information. These products are:

- Connect (Gen 2)
- Connect:Amp (Gen 2)
- One (Gen 1)
- Play:1
- Play:3
- Play:5 (Gen 2)
- Playbar
- Playbase
- Sub (Gen 1)
- Sub (Gen 2)
- SYMFONISK Bookshelf (Gen 1)
- SYMFONISK Table lamp (Gen 1)

If you have any of these products in your Sonos system, first go through the above process of updating Wi-Fi information for any supported products. Once your supported products are updated, factory reset any products that could not be discovered, then add them back to your Sonos system.

If your Sonos system only contains products from the list above, you can reconnect your Sonos system to your network using one of the options below.

#### Switch to a Wired Setup

When wired to a router, some Sonos products can broadcast their own dedicated wireless network that other Sonos products can use.

If you have Sonos products that support this, you can temporarily use your Sonos system in a wired setup as a workaround. You can find instructions on how to switch to a wired setup, as well as a list of products that don't support this type of setup, in [this article](https://support.sonos.com/en-us/article/switch-sonos-between-a-wireless-and-wired-setup).

#### Reset Your Sonos Products and Set Them Up Again

If your Sonos system only contains products from the list above and you can't wire a product to your router, you'll need to reset each product and set them up again as a new system. During the setup process, you'll provide each of your Sonos products with your updated Wi-Fi network name and password.

If you would like assistance with this process, please [contact Sonos Support](https://support.sonos.com/en-us/contact).

1. [Factory reset](https://support.sonos.com/en-us/article/factory-reset-sonos-products) each Sonos product in your system. This will erase all existing system data, including settings, Sonos Playlists, and Sonos Favorites.
2. Close and re-open the Sonos app. If all of your products have been reset, the Sonos app will display "No products found."
3. Go to the **Settings** menu. Your reset products will be detected nearby and show a setup banner at the top of the screen.
4. Select one of your reset products and follow the steps in the app to set it up again. You'll select a Wi-Fi network and provide a Wi-Fi password during this step.
5. Repeat step 4 for any remaining products that were reset.
6. Add any [content services](https://support.sonos.com/en-us/article/add-music-services-to-sonos) or [voice services](https://support.sonos.com/en-us/article/voice-services-and-sonos) that were previously on your system.

Once completed, all of your Sonos products will be set up again and connected to your network with the newest Wi-Fi credentials.

### If Sonos Connects Through Your Wi-Fi Network

If your Sonos system is in a [wireless setup](https://support.sonos.com/en-us/article/choose-between-a-wireless-and-wired-sonos-setup), follow the steps below. If you have more than one Sonos product in your system, this process will require you to temporarily connect a Sonos product to your router with an Ethernet cable.

1. Open the Sonos S1 Controller app and wait while it searches for your Sonos system.
2. When you see the message "Unable to connect to Sonos," select **Learn More**.
3. Select **Changed router or Wi-Fi settings?**
4. Follow the instructions to connect Sonos to your new router or Wi-Fi network.

If some of your Sonos products are missing from your Rooms list after you've wired a Sonos product, [reboot all missing Sonos products in your household](https://support.sonos.com/en-us/article/reboot-sonos-products), then go to **Settings > System > Network > Wireless Setup** to connect them to the Wi-Fi network.

### If a Sonos Product Is Wired to Your Network with an Ethernet Cable

If your Sonos system is in a wired setup, simply wire your Sonos product to your new router to get connected. Some of your Sonos products may be missing from your Rooms list because they need information from the new router. To fix this, reboot all missing Sonos products in your household.
